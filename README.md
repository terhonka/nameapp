Start the "JSON Server" with "npm run server" (runs in http://localhost:3001/)
Start the client with "npm start" (runs in http://localhost:3000/)

This is a simple react web application that implements the four requirements in
the academy ecercise description.

The UI is very simple and just do demonstrate the functionality: By pressing a named
button the application views the required functionality - in case of a user given
name there opens a text box to input the name.

The "server" is as an emulated "JSON server" since the function is only to provide
the name data in JSON format.

For simplicity the application is implemented copletely in file index.js file
instead of introducing very small components for services. The code does not contain
any comments either since the functionality is simple and self documenting.
